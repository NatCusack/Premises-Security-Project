This week I recieved the first set of parts for my project:
	- Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB)		€49.63
	- Raspberry Pi Camera V2	€28.40
	- Raspberry Pi 4 Power Supply	€ 6.96
	- 16GB Class 10 SD Card		€ 8.68

I had some servo motors lying around so I plan to use them to 
represent the electric gates.

My plan for this week is:
	- Set up ssh and portforwarding on the Pi
	- Use the GPIO pins of the Pi to control 2 servo motors
	- Start work on running a web server off the Pi

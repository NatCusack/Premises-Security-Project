This week I mainly focused on on my web server, I spent time on getting
the raspberry pi camera to stream to the web page.I also set up a login in 
page. On the home page I added a button to redirect the user to the live
fedd from the camera. I noticed the the lattency lag from the camera to 
the server was very high so I must research if there is a more efficient 
way to stream the raspberry pi camera.

I also researched and designed a 3 x 4 keypad that is going to used as a
way to open the gates. It will be using a column row matrix to detect key 
presses. 

I created a gerber file for a pcb and sent it on to be milled.

My plan for next week is:
	- solder and test the PCB for the Keypad
	- create a database for storing:
		1) Approved Licence Plates
		2) All Images that return a plate
		3) Date and time of each plate captured

Name: Nathan Cusack
Project: Premises Security using Automatic Number Plate Recognition

___________________________________________________________________
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This week I researched OpenALPR which is an automatic licence plate
recognition package built on OpenCV that scores high accuracy on character 
recognition. I decided to use this package instead of building my own 
system to save on time so I could spend more time working on the rest of
the project

After testing OpenALPR I wrote a small script to use the Raspberry Pi
Camera to take a picture, then scan that picture for licence plates and 
return the top 10 results. Testiing the script on my own car, I found 
that the accuracy was very poor. After more research I found out that
by default that OpenALPR is configured for US licence plates. Next week
I will work on configuring OpenAPLR to on EU plates and change the 
pattern to match that of EU licence plate.  



My plan for next week is:
	- web cam streaming to apache server
	- design keypad schematic for raspberry pi
	- improve python script for ALPR
